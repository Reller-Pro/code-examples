# Best Practices for Angular, .NET Core and Git

In this repository, you will find the best practices for Angular, .NET Core and Git. 
The aim of this document is to provide guidelines and recommendations that can help developers create better 
applications with these technologies.

# Briefly about the main:

## Angular Best Practices

1. Use component-based architecture: Organize your application into components that represent specific parts of the app, and they should be reusable and independent.
2. Use Reactive Programming: Use RxJs to create reactive code that is simple, concise, and easy to maintain.
3. Follow naming conventions: Consistently naming variables, functions, and classes will make it easier for other developers to understand the codebase.
4. Use Angular CLI: Angular CLI is a powerful tool that can help you create, test, and deploy your application quickly.
5. Avoid using Global Variables: It's good practice to avoid using global variables as it can cause bugs, make debugging difficult, and reduce the reusability of code.
6. Use Service Workers: A service worker is a script that runs in the background of your application, allowing you to provide offline and caching functionality.

## .NET Core Best Practices

1. Follow SOLID design principles: SOLID principles make your application more flexible, extensible, and easy to maintain.
2. Use Dependency Injection: Dependency injection makes your application easier to test, maintain and extend.
3. Use .NET Core libraries: Use .NET Core libraries instead of third-party libraries, as they are optimized for use with .NET Core and provide better performance.
4. Use Middleware: Middleware provides a flexible way to handle requests and responses in your application.
5. Use Async/Await: Async/await makes it easier to write asynchronous code that is more efficient and easier to read.

## Git Best Practices

1. Use descriptive commit messages: Good commit message practices should be brief and clear, describing changes made to the code.
2. Use branches: Branches provide a great way to experiment with new features and isolate work from the main branch.
3. Use pull requests: Pull requests help to review and merge changes into the main codebase after ensuring that all changes made are adequate and doesn't break existing rules.
4. Use Git's stash feature: If you need to switch branches, but you have changes you don't want to commit yet, the stash command can help you save the changes and switch branches without losing progress.
5. Keep your Git history clean: Keep it tidy by removing merge branches or rebasing your work.

### Conclusion

These are the best practices for Angular, .NET Core, and Git. 
By following these guidelines, it will improve your development experience, help avoid errors, 
and make your codebase cleaner and more maintainable. End of Readme.md content.
